Voodoo Javascript Library - Version 0.9.0 (Public Beta)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Voodoo is a Javascript library for developing reusable 3D web objects that
intermix freely among 2D content. A common framework is provided to create new
objects by extending Model and View base types. Also provided is a core engine
to draw these 3D objects together on a page. See documentation and samples
for more information.
